<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Özkan</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Software Apprentice</h3>
<h5 align="center">The most perfect code is the code that hasn’t been written yet</h5>

- 🔭 I use this account as a memory log while I explore new tools.

- 🛠️ You’ll see works-in-progress—and yes, also unfinished projects.

- 💻 I mainly focus on full-stack tools. JavaScript was my first sword in this battle, so I’ve tried many projects with related Frameworks.

- 🌱 On the backend, I started with Java and I’m currently building apps with Spring Boot.
